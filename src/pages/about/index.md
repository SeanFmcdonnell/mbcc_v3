### Youth

During the 10:30 AM worship service on Sundays, the Youth Coordinator invites the children to come forward for a message just for them. After this Children’s Devotional, children are dismissed to the kid’s room for the remainder of the Sunday worship service. They go to a classroom with the youth coordinator who has a lesson and message prepared for them. The lesson follows United Church of Christ (UCC) church calendar as it aligns with the current theme in worship. While parents attend service, the children enjoy a fun and dynamic Sunday school lesson that is faith based driven; incorporating art, music, drama and dance. Youth productions at Christmas, Easter and other holidays, art workshops, solo singing and choir lessons, amongst other activities, keeps this ministry creative!

### Rentals

Let Miami Beach Community Church be the venue of your next event. Weather it is King Chapel for a more intimate gathering or Hice Hall for larger gatherings, Miami Beach Community Church is the perfect place for wedding receptions, Anniversary, Birthday Party, Baby Shower, Corporate Event or any Social Gatherings / Celebration.

### Restoration

Church services are being provided in Hice Hall during construction. We continue with our multi-layer restoration of our campus on Lincoln road. A full restoration of our 1921 sanctuary – our lovely Mediterranean Revival building, designed by famed architect Walter DeGarmo and built on land donated by Carl and Jane Fisher. As MBCC approaches our Centennial Celebration in 2021, it is our hope and passion to continue to service our community with renewed energy, vision, faith, love and a fully renovated campus for the next 100 years!

### Women Inspired Now

Direct trade is a form of sourcing practiced by some coffee roasters. Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price negotiation between buyer and farmer, along with systems that encourage and incentivize quality.

### Funerals and Memorials 

At this time of your family’s loss we are here to assist you with the immediate need of planning a service to celebrate the life of your loved one. We also will continue to be available in the weeks and months that follow by providing bereavement counseling and support as well as assistance with the many details that must be attended to after a death.

### Baptisms

During the worship service, your family will be invited to gather around the Baptism Font. Parents, in consultation with the pastor, may choose sponsors or godparents for infants and young children who are to be baptized. In addition, you may invite any close friends and family to join you. Those who stand with your family will be asked if they “promise, through prayer and example, to support and encourage the person being baptized to be a faithful Christian?” A similar question is then asked of the congregation. The pastor will then ask the individual being baptized, or the parents several questions. A prayer of thanksgiving and blessing is said over the Baptism waters. The pastor will then take the person and baptize them in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Following the act of Baptism, the pastor will introduce the individual as the newest member of our church.

### Weddings

Marriage is a time of public commitment between two individuals who wish to affirm their life together and we are always honored when couples ask us to be part of their wedding. For people seeking to be married, a marriage service is a sign of hope, a fulfillment of desire, and one of the most special occasions in their lives.  From the church’s perspective, marriage is a gift of God, a sacred and holy covenant between two individuals that has its foundation in the faithfulness of God’s love.
