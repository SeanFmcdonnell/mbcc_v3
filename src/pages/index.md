        Baptism with water and the Holy Spirit is the sign and seal of our
        common discipleship. Since baptism is God’s gift, the Holy Spirit is
        called to be upon the water and those being baptized. The act of baptism
        also marks the beginning of a new life of discipleship with Christ, the
        human response to that gift.

        Our congregation encourages them to “grow up in the light of God” as
        kind and caring love ambassadors spreading the good news about Jesus and
        his profound ministry. At Miami Beach Community Church (MBCC) children
        and youth express themselves through the arts, discuss beliefs and honor
        their spiritual growth.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
